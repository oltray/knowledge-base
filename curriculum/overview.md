# Curriculum Overview

> Your guided path through the knowledge base — offline, self-paced, no internet required.

This curriculum turns the reference documentation in your library into a structured
learning experience. Each track has modules that explain concepts and point you to
the local docs you've already downloaded.

2. You do hands-on exercises that use those docs
3. No internet needed — everything is stored locally
