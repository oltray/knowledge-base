# Track 01 — Languages: JavaScript

> **Level:** Beginner–Intermediate
> **Goal:** Read, write, and understand JavaScript programs; master async patterns and the module system

## Why JavaScript

JavaScript is the only language that runs natively in every browser — and with Node.js,
it runs on servers too. Understanding it deeply (not just "make the button work") means
understanding the type system, closures, the event loop, and the module ecosystem that
most modern development depends on.

## Modules

| # | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [JavaScript Orientation](./01-javascript-orientation.md) | Runtimes, the ecosystem, and how to read MDN |
| 2 | [Language Fundamentals](./02-language-fundamentals.md) | Types, scope, closures, and `this` |
| 3 | [Async Patterns](./03-async-patterns.md) | Callbacks, promises, and async/await |
| 4 | [Modules and Node.js](./04-modules-and-node.md) | CommonJS, ES Modules, and running JS outside the browser |
